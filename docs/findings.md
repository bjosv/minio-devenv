# Findings

## standalone mode:
If single node: all 4 pods on same
Uses Deployment

## distributed mode:
On pod on each K8s node (when available)
Uses StatefulSet
StatefulSets need persistent storage
Note that the replicas value should be a minimum value of 4

## Healing
MinIO server now supports auto-heal.
but previouly following was needed:
`mc admin heal -r play`

## Rebalance / Heal
mc config host add ALIAS_NAME YOUR-MINIO-ENDPOINT YOUR-ACCESS-KEY YOUR-SECRET-KEY
mc admin heal --recursive ALIAS_NAME


## Network storage
Thereâ€™s one caveat when using clustered network storage solution (eg. Ceph/ GlusterFS / Rook.io), the IO performance will drop by ~60% of its original performance because of data replication, but of course you donâ€™t have to worry about data loss when the disks/nodes are missing.

* If you want the disk to be repopulated immediatelly, you should run `mc admin heal --recursive myminio` so that the whole instance is healed, if you didn't do this, the server would do it automatically later, when the auto-heal feature kicks in, which happens every 24 hours according to how the feature was implemented



* I have a distributed cluster with 4 nodes. After a node was taken out of service and had its volume wiped, when i start the cluster, the console shows the message that unformatted disk found,how do i repaire the broken node? help me, please, thank you!

mc admin heal -r myminio
